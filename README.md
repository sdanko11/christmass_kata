Sometimes it's useful to know on which day of week the holly holiday will occur.

But just don't limit ourselves to this year and write a function which consumes a 

Christmas date and outputs a name of weekday. 

Example:

find_out_christmas_weekday('2013 12 25') # returns 'Wednesday'

Only valid Christmas dates will be passed to the function.

Date parameter could be a string or a Date object. If it's a string here are possible date parameter formats:

'2013 12 25'

'12 25 2013'

'25 December 2013'
